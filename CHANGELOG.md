# Changelog

## 1.6.0 — 2026-09-27

- Ship the existing deterministic Rust/WASM refinement pass and studio toggle with intensity 0–10. Manual and hidden node/label pairs remain fixed; ring snapping constrains candidates. Settings survive JSON, share links, SVG and workflow generation.
- Give keyboard-selected studio nodes an explicit focus outline, including when glow is disabled. Node buttons support Enter, Space, Escape and Shift-selection.
- Report omitted labels and their reasons in the studio filter summary. Rendering callers can receive `label-omitted` diagnostics through the fourth argument's `onDiagnostic` callback without changing SVG output.
- Retain default SVG output when refinement is disabled.
